Goal
=============================
Resolve mouse gestures usability problem on plugins like Adobe Flash.

Currently only supports Firefox.

Status
=============================
Working prototype, with a bootstrapped (no restart) extension part.

Supports OOP plugins and some in-process plugins.

For recent Adobe Flash Player versions, **you must [turn off protected mode](http://www.ghacks.net/2012/06/10/flash-player-update-fix-freezes-crashes-in-firefox/)** in order to make mouse gestures work.

Build
=============================
Open FlashGestures.sln with Visual Studio 2013 and build the solution.

After successful building, you will get the add-on file of the name FlashGestures32.xpi.
